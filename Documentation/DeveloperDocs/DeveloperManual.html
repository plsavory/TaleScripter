          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            TaleScripter is a Visual Novel game engine written in C++ which is built around using a database to structure content.
          </p>

          <p>
            TaleScripter is currently in a very early stage of development and is currently not yet suitable for general use.
          </p>

          <p>
            The actual game engine/runner is currently being worked on, however there is currently not a functional development environment
            for actually developing games using TaleScripter. This is planned for the future, but currently the game must be manually built
            by inserting data into the Novel and Resource databases using SQL. This will not be the case once the engine has developed enough
            such that developing a full game will be possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea of using a database is so that (When we have a working UI), it will be possible to develop a visual novel with little
            to no programming experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            In future, scripting will be possible using Lua, to be able to add interactive scenes and animated visual elements etc, but this
            functionality is currently missing from the engine and will be implemented in due course.
          </p>

          <p>
            This document is not a user manual, rather it is intended for people who are actually working on developing the engine itself.
            Once we have a website, this document will be unneccesary as this text will be able to be placed onto there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the engine is in a more finished state, real user manual will be written.
